What values are returned during the following sequence of deque ADT
operations, on an initially empty deque? addFirst(3), addLast(8), addLast(9),
addFirst(1), last( ), isEmpty( ), addFirst(2), removeLast( ), addLast(7), first( ),
last( ), addLast(4), size( ), removeFirst( ), removeFirst( ).


Suppose you have a deque D containing the numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), in this
order. Suppose further that you have an initially empty queue Q. Give a code
fragment that uses only D and Q (and no other variables) and results in D storing
the elements in the order (1,2,3,5,4,6,7,8).


Repeat the previous problem using the deque D and an initially empty stack S.
